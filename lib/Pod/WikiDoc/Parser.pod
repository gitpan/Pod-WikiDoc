=head1 NAME

Pod::WikiDoc::Parser -- precompiled recursive descent parser for Pod::WikiDoc

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Pod::WikiDoc::Parser;
 
     my $parser = Pod::WikiDoc::Parser->new();
 
     my $tree = $parser->WikiDoc( $text );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a precompiled L<Parse::RecDescent> parser for use with L<Pod::WikiDoc>.
It is generated dynamically on installation of L<Pod::WikiDoc> from a grammer
included with the distribution.  

A copy of the L<Parse::RecDescent> grammer used is appended to the
Pod::WikiDoc::Parser source file for reference or reuse by others.

=head1 USAGE

This module is a support module for L<Pod::WikiDoc> and is not intended for
general use.  Given a string containing WikiDoc markup text, the parser
produces a data structure representing the parsed content.  The data structure
returned is an array of references to hashes.  Keys in the hash are:

=over

=item *

type: the parser rule that generated the hash

=item *

content: either a reference to another AoH or a string of text

=item *

level: (only for "Header" type hashes) the level of the header

=back

See L<Pod::WikiDoc> for details of the markup.

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are numerous Perl wikitext parsers, formatters or translators, some of
which were instructive in designing this parser.  All the ones I could find are
included below for reference for those interested in the topic.
