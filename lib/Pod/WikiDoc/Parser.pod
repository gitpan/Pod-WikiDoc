Pod::WikiDoc::Parser - precompiled recursive descent parser for Pod::WikiDoc

=head1 VERSION

version 0.19

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pod::WikiDoc::Parser;

    my $parser = Pod::WikiDoc::Parser->new();

    my $tree = $parser->WikiDoc( $text );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pod::WikiDoc::Parser is a precompiled L<Parse::RecDescent> parser for use with
L<Pod::WikiDoc>.

A copy of the Parse::RecDescent grammar used is appended to the
Pod::WikiDoc::Parser source and this Pod file for reference or reuse by
others.

=head1 USAGE

This module is a support module for Pod::WikiDoc and is not intended for
general use.  Given a string containing WikiDoc markup text, the parser
produces a data structure representing the parsed content.  The data structure
returned is an array of references to hashes.  Keys in the hash are:

=over

=item *

type: the parser rule that generated the hash

=item *

content: either a reference to another AoH or a string of text

=item *

level: (only for "Header" type hashes) the level of the header

=back

See L<Pod::WikiDoc> for details of the markup.
